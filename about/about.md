>[[To pip Package]](https://pypi.org/project/deepsynthbody/)

A novel framework to solve data deficiency problems caused by privacy issues and time-consuming and costly medical data annotation processes.

## Main objectives of Deepsynthbody are:
* Overcome the privacy related limitations for medical data by producing open access deep synthetic data.
* Reduce the time-consuming and resource-consuming process of medical data labeling and annotation.
* Find inter-correlations of human body organs (how one organ affect to other organs) and functions and reproduce them to produce a new model for the human body.

## Additionaly, Deepsynthbody works as:
* A repository for deep generative models used in medicine.
* A data compression mechanism to keep big medical data sets in a small storage without any privacy concerns and space to save large amounts of the data

## Architecture of DeepSynthBody framework

## Generative models are organized under 11 categories which may contain subcategories and subsub categories.
1. Cardiovascular
   - ECG model.
2. Digestive 
   - GI tract
3. Endocrine
4. Integumentary
5. Lymphatic
6. Muscular
7. Nervous
8. Urinary
9. Reproductive
10. Respiratory
11. Skeletal
