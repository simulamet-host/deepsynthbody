# About DeepSynthBody: the beginning of the end for data deficiency in medicine
<br/>
<br/>


## Main objectives of DeepSynthBody is to,
<br/>

- overcome the privacy related limitations for medical data by producing open access deep synthetic data.
- reduce the time-consuming and resource-consuming process of medical data labeling and annotation.
- find inter-correlations of human body organs (how one organ affect to other organs) and functions and reproduce them to produce a new model for the human body.


<br/>

## Additionaly, DeepSynthBody works as:

<br/>


- a repository for deep generative models used in medicine.
- a data compression mechanism to keep big medical data sets in a small storage without any privacy concerns and space to save large amounts of the data
