We are working on CPU version.\n```\n\n### Run on GPU - generation process\n\n```python\nimport deepsynth_gitract\n\ndeepsynth_gitract.generate(name, result_dir, checkpoint_dir, num_img_per_tile, num_of_outputs, trunc_psi=0.75):\n    \"\"\" Generate deepsynth Gastrointestinal tract images.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    name -- Any name to keep trac of generations\n    result_dir -- A directory to save output\n    checkpoint_dir -- A directory to download pre-trained checkpoints\n    num_img_per_tile -- Number of images per dimenstion of the grid\n    num_of_outputs -- Number of outputs to generate\n    trunc_psi -- value between 0.5 and 1.0 (default 0.75)\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n### Run on GPU - to generate interpolations between random points\n\n```python\ndeepsynth_gitract.generate_interpolation(name, result_dir, checkpoint_dir, num_img_per_tile, num_of_outputs, num_of_steps_to_interpolate, save_frames, trunc_psi=0.75):\n    \"\"\" Generate deepsynth Gastrointestinal tract images.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    name -- Any name to keep trac of generations\n    result_dir -- A directory to save output\n    checkpoint_dir -- A directory to download pre-trained checkpoints\n    num_img_per_tile -- Number of images per dimenstion of the grid\n    num_of_outputs -- Number of outputs to generate\n    num_of_steps_to_interpolate -- Number of step between two random points\n    save_frames -- True if you want frame by frame, otherwise .gif will be generated\n    trunc_psi -- value between 0.5 and 1.0 (default 0.75)\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests are welcome.
